# About Listing Properties

## Overview

A **listing property** within the Leviathan PCRMS represents the information and settings related to how your property is presented on various Online Travel Agency (OTA) platforms. It is the interface through which potential guests view availability, amenities, and make reservations. Managing a listing property effectively ensures that your property is visible, competitive, and accurately represented across all connected channels.

## Key Components of a Listing Property

### Reservations

#### The reservations section of a listing property is where all guest bookings are managed. This includes:
- **Booking Details**: Information about current, past, and upcoming reservations, including guest names, stay dates, and payment status.
- **Reservation Management**: Tools to modify, cancel, or add reservations manually, as well as handling special requests or notes related to each booking.
- **Integration**: Seamless syncing of reservations from various OTAs and direct booking channels to ensure accurate availability and avoid double bookings.

### Calendar

#### The calendar is a crucial tool within the listing property, providing a visual representation of booking activity. Features include:
- **Availability**: A clear view of booked and available dates, helping you manage open slots and optimize occupancy rates.
- **Pricing**: Ability to adjust pricing dynamically based on demand, special events, or seasonal trends.
- **Block Dates**: Option to block off dates for maintenance, owner stays, or other non-bookable periods, ensuring no accidental reservations are made during these times.

## Best Practices for Managing Listing Properties

- **Consistency**: Ensure that all details, including property descriptions, photos, and amenities, are consistent across all OTAs to avoid guest confusion.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep your calendar, pricing, and promotions updated to reflect current availability and market conditions.
- **Monitor Performance**: Regularly review the performance of your listing on different OTAs to identify which channels are most effective and adjust your strategy accordingly.

By effectively managing these components, you can maximize your property's visibility, optimize bookings, and ensure a seamless experience for both you and your guests.
