# Leviathan PCRMS Overview

## Understanding Physical and Listing Properties

The **Leviathan PCRMS** (Property Channel and Revenue Management System) is designed to work based on two core concepts: **physical properties** and **listing properties**.

### Physical Property

A physical property represents the actual, tangible location where your guests will stay. This could be a single unit within a building or a group of units. The physical property is defined within the system and can be organized as follows:
- **Single Unit Property**: An individual unit within a building or complex(Building).
- **Group of Units**: Multiple units grouped together, often within the same building or complex.

### Listing Property

A listing property is what you present on OTA (Online Travel Agency) channels. This is the property as it appears to potential guests when they search for accommodations. The listing property must be carefully mapped to the corresponding physical property within the Leviathan PCRMS.

## Mapping Properties Correctly

### Mapping a Listing Property to a Physical Property

It is crucial to ensure that listing properties are mapped correctly to physical properties:
- **Single Unit Listing Property**: Map this to a corresponding single physical unit.
- **Multi-Unit Listing Property**: Map this to a group of physical units.

### Multi-Unit Listing Property Management

When a listing property is classified as multi-unit, the system will check the availability within the group of units. If there is no "back-to-back" availability (i.e., no consecutive bookings that prevent gaps), the system will automatically choose the first available unit within the group.

## Best Practices

1. **Accurate Mapping**: Always ensure accurate mapping between listing properties and physical properties to avoid booking errors.
2. **Group Management**: For multi-unit listings, group your units correctly to facilitate efficient management by the system.
3. **Availability Check**: Understand that the systemâ€™s logic for multi-unit listings will prioritize finding the first available unit unless constrained by back-to-back bookings.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage your properties and listings within the Leviathan PCRMS, ensuring a smooth experience for both property managers and guests.
